# How Quantum Computing Works

Up until now, you've recieved a hearty dose of all these formal definitions and goals for Quantum Computing but we've never really touched on HOW it works besides hinting at it in the explanation of __BQP__ time complexity.

Now that you know the goals and driving motivations for Quantum Computing, you can start to understand its principles of operation in context of performance and how they can give an avenue to those speed-ups witnessed.

There are three main topics we'd like to go over:

* Quantum Mechanics
* The Qubit
* DiVincenzo's Criteria

Quantum mechanics will dictate the behavior of the Qubit, which is the fundamental unit of computation that Quantum Computers use, while DiVincenzo's Criteria are the criteria that need to be satisfied to have a Quantum Computer that can execute Quantum Algorithms and simulations.

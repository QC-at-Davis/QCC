# Mathematical Tools

Before we can take the leap into understanding how gates work and understanding existing quantum circuits/algorithms, you'll need to have a few mathematical tools under your belt

They have been split into four sections

* Linear Algebra
* Dirac Notation
* Core Quantum Mechanics
* Bloch Sphere

__Linear Algebra__ is the bare minimum you'll need to hit the ground running. We start simple with vectors and move our way up to the Outer Product, all key tools you'll need to express qubit operations.

Once the math is settled, we introduce a new, succinct way of expressing a lot of the __Linear Algebra__ you see called __Dirac Notation__ which is the icing on the cake.

__Core Quantum Mechanics__ digs further into the Quantum Mechanics that __Dirac Notation__ was intended for as well as giving key insights into some of the peculiarities of QC. 

We top things off with a visual grand finale, the __Bloch Sphere__ which provides a nice way of actually "seeing" the superposition state a singular qubit is in.

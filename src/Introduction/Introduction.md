Welcome to the __Quantum Computing Codex (QCC)__ created by __Quantum Computing at Davis (QCaD)__ !

## Purpose

This book is designed as guide for those interested in Quantum Computing but just don't know where to start as well as a suitable reference for seasoned Quantum Computing Developers.

The QCC was created in response to the "gap" in Quantum Computing resources between "What is Quantum Computing" vs. Research papers, with very little thorough documentation that would permit a beginner to reach a desired level of proficiency 

## Citation System

The contents of this book are by no means the work of one individual, relying on an amalgamation of sources that have been presented in what is believed to be the most beginner friendly way possible.

### Text
In most cases, you will find a superscript number after a sentence or section. You can scroll to the bottom of the page to find the corresponding name of the source and a URL to it.

However, some sections may have the superscript in the header. This means the subsequent text was heavily based on its original source, and is done to point out that most of the modification lay in summarization or the paraphrasing of details before incorporation in this work. 

It is also possible to find smaller superscripts in a section of text that already has a superscript. This is to denote the introduction of work from another source and its overlap with the existing body of text. 

### Images

Each image is immediately followed by a link to the source. This link is not included in the bottom of each page.

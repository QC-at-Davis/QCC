Welcome to the __Quantum Computing Codex (QCC)__ created by __Quantum Computing at Davis (QCaD)__ !

## Purpose

This book is designed as guide for those interested in Quantum Computing but just don't know where to start as well as a suitable reference for seasoned Quantum Computing Developers.

The QCC was created in response to the "gap" in Quantum Computing resources between "What is Quantum Computing" vs. Research papers, with very little thorough documentation that would permit a beginner to reach a desired level of proficiency

# Quantum Computing Codex (QCC)

A resource for the aspiring Quantum Software Developer, developed by Quantum Computing at Davis (QCaD).

__NOTE:__ This book is under active development and revision and is subject to change without notice.

## CURRENT STATUS

Github has made some changes that have caused the live version of the text to fail. Rest assured, work is under way to have this fixed as soon as possible before new content is added.

## Requirements

You'll need the Rust compiler and an associated package known as `mdbook` which renders the markdown files.

To install Rust, follow this [link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once that's installed you can install `mdbook` [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)

## Using the Book

Clone this repository to a desired directory on your system, then navigate to that directory using your command line and run the following in that repository:

```
mdbook serve
```

This launches a local server. You can go to any browser of your choice and type in the following as a URL:

```
localhost:3000
```
The book should load within your browser
